# Hamiltonian Path Generator with Frequency Partition Evolution

This Python program explores the fascinating problem of constructing Hamiltonian Paths (HPs) based on their "Frequency Partition" (FP), which defines the distribution of edge lengths (hops) in the path. It simulates an "inductive" approach, attempting to build larger paths by extending smaller, previously found ones.

## The Problem Explored

A **Hamiltonian Path** is a path in a graph that visits each vertex exactly once.
A **Frequency Partition (FP)** describes how many times each possible "hop length" (distance between connected vertices in a cyclic graph sense) appears in a Hamiltonian Path. For example, if you have 10 vertices, a hop of length 1 connects adjacent vertices, a hop of length 2 connects vertices that are two apart, etc.

This program tries to:
1.  **Generate HPs:** Given a desired FP, it attempts to construct a Hamiltonian Path.
2.  **Evolve FPs:** It then tries to gradually change (evolve) the FP to create new, slightly larger problems.
3.  **Test Conditions:** It incorporates a necessary mathematical condition (the BHR divisor condition) to quickly rule out impossible FPs.

## How It Works (Briefly)

The program uses a sequence of strategies to find the Hamiltonian Path for each evolved Frequency Partition:
1.  **Reuse Insert:** Attempts to simply insert a new vertex into the previously found path. This is very fast if it works.
2.  **Greedy Insert:** Tries various insertions and picks the "best fit," then checks for an exact match.
3.  **Backtracking Search:** If the simpler methods fail, it resorts to a brute-force search (backtracking). This method explores many possibilities, but it's computationally very expensive.

## My Key Observations / Findings

I noticed a significant challenge:

* **The "Inductive Wall":** While the program effectively builds paths for smaller numbers of vertices (e.g., up to `p=35`), it often gets "stuck" for higher vertex counts.
* **Example: p=36 vs. p=40:** Surprisingly, I observed that a specific case for `p=36` vertices became incredibly difficult for the program to solve (getting stuck), even though another case for `p=40` vertices worked previously. This highlights a crucial point: **the difficulty isn't just about the size of the graph, but also the specific pattern of required edge lengths (the Frequency Partition) for that graph.** Some patterns are much harder to solve than others, even if they are smaller.
* **Computational Limits:** This program demonstrates a core concept in computer science: for problems known as "NP-complete," even powerful computers struggle dramatically as the problem size increases. Doubling the computer's speed doesn't help much when the problem difficulty grows exponentially or factorially! Using high-performance platforms like Google Colab Pro+ also didn't solve this, indicating the bottleneck is in the algorithm's fundamental approach, not just hardware.

## Running the Program

1.  Save the code as a Python file (e.g., `hp_generator.py`).
2.  Run from your terminal: `python hp_generator.py`
3.  Follow the prompts to enter an initial Hamiltonian Path, its Frequency Partition, and the number of iterations.

**Example Input:**
* **Hamiltonian Path:** `0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10` (11 vertices, 10 edges)
* **Frequency Partition Tuple:** `6,2,1,1` (This means 6 hops of length 1, 2 hops of length 2, 1 hop of length 3, 1 hop of length 4. Total edges: 6+2+1+1 = 10, which matches the HP)
* **Mode:** 1 (to increment existing hops and grow the path)
* **Number of Iterations:** (e.g., 30, but be aware it might get stuck!)

## Limitations

* This program relies on a general backtracking algorithm for the hardest cases, which is not efficient for large numbers of vertices (generally `p > ~35-40` can be problematic depending on the specific problem instance).
* It serves more as an exploration and demonstration tool for the underlying mathematical problem and its computational challenges.
